# AlexNet-VS-ResNet
AI360. November 2025. Comparative study of AlexNet &amp; ResNet


## FILES
AlexNet architecture and ResNet architecture files contain the architectures of the corresponding neural networks for training on Tiny ImageNet implemented through PyTorch, similar implementations via torchvision with the last layer replaced.

Testing file contains code for analyzing top1-accuracy, top5-accuracy, and F1 metrics for various learning rates and weight decay.
